		<p><b>I</b>n ages past, it is said that Miki-sama descended to the mortal realm,<br>
 		graced with divine insight to aid those enthralled by tales of m/m/m.<br>
		 Sharing the ancient wisdom of Tachiyomi, he forged a fellowship among <br>
		kindred spirits, united in their pursuit of knowledge and tranquility.<br>
		Yet, as the community thrived, whispers of darkness crept in.</p>
	<p> Some sought 
		to twist this sacred knowledge for personal gain, threatening to disrupt <br>
		the harmony that Miki-sama had fostered. Recognizing the peril, Miki-sama <br>
		summoned the wise Mods, who laid down gentle rules to safeguard the purity<br>
 		of their shared passion.</p>
	<p>But even with these safeguards, a shadow lingered. Those with ill intentions <br>
		persisted, their actions casting doubt upon the community's unity. With a heavy <br>
		heart, Miki-sama faced a solemn decision. </p>
	<p> A tale whispered through the ages, he
 		decreed the first Purgeâ€”a fateful act to cleanse their midst of <br> those who sought to 
		sow discord and harm. Thus, the Purge became a cautionary tale, <br>passed down among the 
		Tachiyomi community like an ember of wisdom, <br>
		reminding all who cherish their shared journey of the importance of vigilance and unity <br>
 		in the face of adversity. </p>
